This is a TI BASIC game, one of my very early attempts. Joysticks are required.

A compiled version by TMOP is also included.

Obviously, this is not a official product and it was something I wrote when I was pretty young.

A nightmare on elm street the game by Mike Ward based on the movie of the same name.

You are Nancy. You are asleep. Freddy is certain that he will get you.

Wander the house and shut doors to slow Freddy down. If you live until the alarm goes off, you win the level.

Of course, you can't stay awake forever, and Freddy is waiting for you...
